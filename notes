If you see “PORT IS IN USE,” close previous inspector sessions or free the port. On Windows:
Find PID: netstat -ano | findstr :6277
Kill: taskkill /PID <PID> /F

Ask: What tools are available?
Weather: Use weatherService.current with {"city":"Chennai"}
File list: Use fileSystem.list with {"path":"sample"}


“Using weatherService, show current weather for Chennai.”
“Using fileSystem, list files in sample/data.”
“Using github-mcp, list my GitHub repos.”
