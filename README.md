# my-mcp-app

This project is a complete Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem in Node.js/TypeScript. It includes:

- **Weather server/client** (mock and real API)
- **File server/client** (list, read, search, logs)
- **MCP configuration** for all endpoints

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol for building modular, tool-using AI agents that can interact with servers, tools, and APIs in a structured way. This project demonstrates how to:

- Build MCP-compliant servers and clients
- Define endpoints and schemas in `mcp.json`
- Create interactive and programmatic clients

## Quick Start

See [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) for setup, build, and usage instructions.

## How to Expand and Enhance

To create your own custom agent or extend this project:

1. **Add new endpoints**: Edit or add new server files in `src/` and update `.vscode/mcp.json`.
2. **Create new clients/agents**: Build interactive or programmatic clients in TypeScript.
3. **Integrate with LangGraph or other frameworks**: Use LangGraph or similar to orchestrate multi-agent workflows, memory, and advanced reasoning.
4. **Host and deploy**: Use Node.js hosting (Vercel, AWS, etc.) or containerize with Docker for deployment.
5. **Deepen MCP understanding**: Study the protocol, schemas, and agent design patterns for advanced use.

For a detailed learning path, roadmap, and advanced expansion steps (including LangGraph, custom agent design, and deep MCP concepts), see [LEARNING_AND_ROADMAP.md](./LEARNING_AND_ROADMAP.md).

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for servers and clients
- `build/` - Compiled JavaScript output
- `.vscode/mcp.json` - MCP configuration
