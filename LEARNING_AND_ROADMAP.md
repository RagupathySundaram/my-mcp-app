# Learning Path & Roadmap

## Learning Path

### 1. Understand the Project
- Read [README.md](./README.md) for a high-level overview.
- Explore the code in `src/` and the endpoint schemas in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

### 2. Quick Start
- Follow [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) to build and run the servers/clients.

### 3. Deep Dive: MCP Protocol
- Study how endpoints are defined and used in `mcp.json`.
- Learn how the MCP client and server communicate (see `src/`).
- Review the Model Context Protocol specification (see official docs online).

### 4. Create & Expand Custom Agents
- Add new endpoints to a server (e.g., new tools, APIs, or data sources).
- Build a new agent in TypeScript that uses multiple endpoints.
- Integrate with external APIs (weather, news, etc.).
- Add memory, context, or multi-step reasoning to your agent.

### 5. Advanced: Orchestration & LangGraph
- Use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) or similar frameworks to:
  - Orchestrate multiple MCP agents and tools
  - Add memory, workflow, and advanced logic
  - Chain tool calls and manage agent state
- Example: Build a super-agent that routes requests to weather, file, and custom tools.

### 6. Hosting & Deployment
- Containerize with Docker or deploy to Node.js platforms (Vercel, AWS, etc.).
- Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

### 7. Contribute & Collaborate
- Open issues, suggest features, or submit pull requests.
- Share your custom agents and workflows with the community.
