# Roadmap: From Simple MCP Server/Client to Agentic AI & Live App

## 1. Start Simple: MCP Server & Client
- Build basic servers and clients (weather, file, etc.) using MCP protocol.
- Define endpoints and schemas in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

## 2. Extend to Agentic AI
- Add new endpoints and tools (learning, tasks, APIs, etc.).
- Build agents that use multiple tools and endpoints.
- Integrate external APIs and data sources.
- Use LangGraph or similar frameworks for:
  - Orchestrating multiple agents
  - Adding memory, workflow, and advanced logic
  - Chaining tool calls and managing agent state
- Example: Create a super-agent that routes requests to weather, file, and custom tools.

## 3. Integrate with UI & Server Frameworks
- Connect your MCP agents to different UI frameworks:
  - React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, etc. (for web)
  - Electron, Tauri (for desktop)
  - React Native, Flutter (for mobile)
- Integrate with server frameworks:
  - Express, Fastify, NestJS, Koa, etc. (Node.js)
  - Python (FastAPI, Flask), Go, Rust, etc.
- Add REST, WebSocket, or GraphQL interfaces for broader integration.

## 4. Deploy & Host the App
- Containerize with Docker or use Node.js platforms (Vercel, AWS, Azure, etc.).
- Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- Add user management, authentication, and progress tracking.
- Make the app interactive and accessible as a learning platform.

## 5. Collaborate & Contribute
- Open issues, suggest features, or submit pull requests.
- Share your custom agents, UI integrations, and workflows with the community.

## Step-by-Step: Build & Run an Agentic AI Travel Assistant

### 1. Weather Agent
- Build or extend the weather server/client to get current weather and forecasts for any city.
- Define endpoints in `.vscode/mcp.json` for weather queries.
- Use free APIs like OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api) for real data.
- Test with: `Weather forecast for Paris`.

### 2. Flight Booking Agent
- Add a new server/client for flight search and booking (mock or real API).
- Endpoints: search flights, book flight, get flight status.
- Use free APIs like AviationStack (https://aviationstack.com/) or Skyscanner (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) for flight data.
- Integrate with external APIs or mock data.
- Test with: `Book a flight from London to Paris on Aug 10`.

### 3. Hotel/Stay Booking Agent
- Add a server/client for hotel or room booking (mock or real API).
- Endpoints: search hotels, book room, get booking details.
- Use free APIs like Hotels API (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/hotels-com) or Booking.com (https://developers.booking.com/) for hotel data.
- Integrate with APIs or mock data.
- Test with: `Book a hotel in Paris for 2 nights starting Aug 10`.

### 4. City Guide & Recommendations
- Add endpoints for city attractions, restaurants, and activities.
- Use free APIs like Foursquare Places (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) or TripAdvisor (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor) for recommendations.
- Integrate with APIs or mock data.
- Test with: `Suggest places to visit in Paris`.

### 5. Orchestrate with Agentic AI
- Use LangGraph or similar to build a super-agent that:
  - Accepts a travel query ("Plan my trip to Paris")
  - Calls weather, flight, hotel, and city guide agents as needed
  - Maintains context and user preferences
  - Returns a complete travel plan
- Example workflow:
  1. User enters city and dates
  2. Agent checks weather
  3. Agent finds flights and books
  4. Agent finds hotels and books
  5. Agent suggests places to visit

### 6. Integrate with UI & Host
- Build a web/mobile UI (React, Next.js, Flutter, etc.) for user interaction
- Connect UI to MCP agents via REST/WebSocket/GraphQL
- Deploy the app (Docker, Vercel, AWS, etc.)

### 7. How to Extend & Become a Robust Agentic AI Project
- Add more agent types (e.g., restaurant booking, event tickets, local transport).
- Integrate with more APIs for richer data and automation.
- Add persistent memory/context for user preferences and history.
- Implement advanced error handling, logging, and monitoring.
- Add authentication, user management, and personalization.
- Expand to support voice/chat interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
- Build advanced workflows (multi-city trips, group travel, etc.).
- Add automated testing and CI/CD for reliability.
- Encourage community contributions and feedback for continuous improvement.
